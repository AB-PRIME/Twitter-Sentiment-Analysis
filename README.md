# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Problem Definition: -
     Sentiment analysis of in the domain of micro-blogging is a relatively new research topic so there is still a lot of room for further research in this area. Decent amount of related prior work has been done on sentiment analysis of user reviews, documents, web blogs/articles and general phrase level sentiment analysis. These differ from twitter mainly because of the limit of 140 characters per tweet which forces the user to express opinion compressed in very short text. The best results reached in sentiment classification use supervised learning techniques such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, but the manual labelling required for the supervised approach is very expensive.
 
 
 Naive Bayes:- 

Many language processing tasks are tasks of classification, although luckily our classes are much easier to define than those of Borges. In this classification we present the naive Bayes algorithms classification, demonstrated on an important classification problem: text categorization, the task of classifying an entire text by assigning it a text categorization label drawn from some set of labels.
 We focus on one common text categorization task, sentiment analysis, the ex-sentiment analysis traction of sentiment, the positive or negative orientation that a writer expresses toward some object. Are view of a movie, book, or product on the web expresses the author’s sentiment toward the product, while an editorial or political text expresses sentiment toward a candidate or political action. Automatically extracting consumer sentiment is important for marketing of any sort of product, while measuring public sentiment is important for politics and also for market prediction. The simplest version of sentiment analysis is a binary classification, and the words of the review provide excellent cues. Consider, for example, the following phrases extracted from positive and negative reviews of movies and restaurants.
 
 
 Libraries: -
 
 
 
1.	Scikit-Learn: - Scikit-Learn library used in this project. Scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
Scikit-learn provide a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.

The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. This stack that includes:
             
•	NumPy: Base n-dimensional array package
•	SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing
•	Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting
•	IPython: Enhanced interactive console
•	Sympy: Symbolic mathematics
•	Pandas: Data structures and analysis


2.	Pandas: - Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.

3.	NumPy: - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

4.	Matplotlib: - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.

5.	Seaborn: - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.
